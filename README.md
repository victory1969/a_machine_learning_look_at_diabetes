# Abstract
The most accurate machine learning model is not always the best one for the job. Good but not great models are useful if the application and related tradeoffs are deeply understood. Mini-mizing the most severe inaccurate predictions is often key to success. This project explores the tuning and evaluation of classification algorithms designed to predict Type-2 Diabetes from various body measurements and demographic characteristics of individuals. Health assess-ment data from the CDC is the data source. The complex process of data mining and its chal-lenges are also described. In short, machine learning models can aid in the fight against a prevalent health issue in the United States as a complement standard blood testing.
